<h1>Can I Win</h1>

<p>In the "100 game" two players take turns adding, to a running total, any integer from <code>1</code> to <code>10</code>. The player who first causes the running total to <strong>reach or exceed</strong> 100 wins.</p>

<p>What if we change the game so that players <strong>cannot</strong> re-use integers?</p>

<p>For example, two players might take turns drawing from a common pool of numbers from 1 to 15 without replacement until they reach a total >= 100.</p>

<p>Given two integers <code>maxChoosableInteger</code> and <code>desiredTotal</code>, return <code>true</code> if the first player to move can force a win, otherwise, return <code>false</code>. Assume both players play <strong>optimally</strong>.</p>
