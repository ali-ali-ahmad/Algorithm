<h1>Divide Two Integers</h1>

<p>Given two integers <code>dividend</code> and <code>divisor</code>, divide two integers <strong>without</strong> using multiplication, division, and mod operator.</p>

<p>The integer division should truncate toward zero, which means losing its fractional part. For example, <code>8.345</code> would be truncated to <code>8</code>, and <code>-2.7335</code> would be truncated to <code>-2</code>.</p>

<p>Return the <strong>quotient</strong> after dividing <code>dividend</code> by <code>divisor</code>.</p>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: Assume we are dealing with an environment that could only store integers within the <strong>32-bit</strong> signed integer range: <code>[−2 pwer to 31, 2 pwer to 31 − 1]</code>. For this problem, if the quotient is <strong>strictly greater than</strong> <code>2 power to 31 - 1</code>, then return <code>2 power to 31 - 1</code>, and if the quotient is <strong>strictly less than</strong> <code>-2 power to 31</code>, then return <code>-2 power to 31</code>.</p>
