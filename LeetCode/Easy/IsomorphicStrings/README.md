<h1>Isomorphic Strings</h1>

<p>Given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, determine if they are isomorphic.</p>

<p>Two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code> are isomorphic if the characters in <code>s</code> can be replaced to get <code>t</code>.</p>

<p>All occurrences of a character must be replaced with another character while preserving the order of characters. No two characters may map to the same character, but a character may map to itself.</p>
