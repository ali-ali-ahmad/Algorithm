<h1>Roman to Integer</h1>

<p>Roman numerals are represented by seven different symbols: <code>I</code>, <code>V</code>, <code>X</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>C</code>, <code>D</code> and <code>M</code>.</p>

<p>For example, <code>2</code> is written as <code>II</code> in Roman numeral, just two ones added together. <code>12</code> is written as <code>XII</code>, which is simply <code>X + II</code>. The number <code>27</code> is written as <code>XXVII</code>, which is <code>XX + V + II</code></p>

<p>Roman numerals are usually written largest to smallest from left to right. However, the numeral for four is not <code>IIII</code>. Instead, the number four is written as <code>IV</code>. Because the one is before the five we subtract it making four. The same principle applies to the number nine, which is written as <code>IX</code>. There are six instances where subtraction is used:</p>

<ul>
    <li><code>I</code> can be placed before <code>V</code> (5) and <code>X</code> (10) to make 4 and 9.</li>
    <li><code>X</code> can be placed before <code>L</code> (50) and <code>C</code> (100) to make 40 and 90.</li>
    <li><code>C</code> can be placed before <code>D</code> (500) and <code>M</code> (1000) to make 400 and 900.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.</p>
