<h1>Reverse Bits</h1>

<p>Reverse bits of a given 32 bits unsigned integer.</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, both input and output will be given as a signed integer type. They should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.</li>
    <li>In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">2's complement notation</a>. Therefore, in Example 2 above, the input represents the signed integer <code>-3</code> and the output represents the signed integer <code>-1073741825</code>.</li>
</ul>
