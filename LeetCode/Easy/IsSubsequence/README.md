<h1>Count the Digits That Divide a Number</h1>

<p>Given two strings <code>s</code> and <code>t</code>, return <code>true</code> if <code>s</code> is a subsequence of <code>t</code>, or <code>false</code> otherwise.</p>

<p>A subsequence of a string is a new string that is formed from the original string by deleting some (can be none) of the characters without disturbing the relative positions of the remaining characters. (i.e., <code>"ace"</code> is a subsequence of <code>"abcde"</code> while <code>"aec"</code> is not).</p>
