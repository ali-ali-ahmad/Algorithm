<h1>Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array</h1>

<p>Given an integer array <code>nums</code> sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm">in-place</a> such that each unique element appears only once. The relative order of the elements should be kept the same. Then return the number of unique elements in <code>nums</code>.</p>

<p>Consider the number of unique elements of <code>nums</code> to be <code>k</code>, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Change the array <code>nums</code> such that the first <code>k</code> elements of <code>nums</code> contain the unique elements in the order they were present in <code>nums</code> initially. The remaining elements of <code>nums</code> are not important as well as the size of <code>nums</code>.</li>
    <li>Return <code>k</code>.</li>
</ul>
