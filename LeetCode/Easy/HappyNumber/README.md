<h1>Happy Number</h1>

<p>Write an algorithm to determine if a number <code>n</code> is happy.</p>

<p>A happy number is a number defined by the following process:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.</li>
    <li>Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.</li>
    <li>Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.</li>
</ul>

<p>Return <code>true</code> if <code>n</code> is a happy number, and <code>false</code> if not.</p>
