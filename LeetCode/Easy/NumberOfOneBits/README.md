<h1>Number of 1 Bits</h1>

<p>Write a function that takes the binary representation of an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight">Hamming weight</a>).</p>

<p>Note:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Note that in some languages, such as Java, there is no unsigned integer type. In this case, the input will be given as a signed integer type. It should not affect your implementation, as the integer's internal binary representation is the same, whether it is signed or unsigned.</li>
    <li>In Java, the compiler represents the signed integers using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two%27s_complement">2's complement notation</a>. Therefore, in Example 3, the input represents the signed integer. <code>-3</code>.</li>
</ul>
