<h1>Linked List Cycle</h1>

<p>Given <code>head</code>, the head of a linked list, determine if the linked list has a cycle in it.</p>

<p>There is a cycle in a linked list if there is some node in the list that can be reached again by continuously following the <code>next</code> pointer. Internally, <code>pos</code> is used to denote the index of the node that tail's <code>next</code> pointer is connected to. Note that <code>pos</code> is not passed as a parameter.</p>

<p>Return <code>true</code> if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return <code>false</code>.</p>
